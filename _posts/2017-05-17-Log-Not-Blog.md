Log Not Blog
============

This was going to be a huge rant about
[log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logbook) vs
[blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog). I was going to add that this’ll be
an entry in my log, not a post. Before you start, “needlessly pedantic” is an
[oxymoron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymoron) not a
[tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(rhetoric)).

The *huge* rant was going to be about the fact that this is another example of
the pointless corruption of words. Right at the top of the log article, I
noticed that the word log itself comes from chip log.

So instead of a huge rant, it’s a minor point. I’m going to use log and not blog
because log is good enough for Captains Kirk, Cook and Shackleton, so it’s good
enough for me.
