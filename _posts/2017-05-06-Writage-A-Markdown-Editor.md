Markdown Editing
================

The whole point of [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is
that it “allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).” Which I why I am
using it.

My primary systems, with keyboards attached, are Windows based so my first
choice was to use Notepad. To say that Notepad is primitive is an
understatement. Perhaps I should have started with WordPad – now I have found an
excellent editor, I have no incentive to try an alternative.

One of the first problems that I discovered is that if you’re going to use a
super simple text editor, then you may not have decent (or any) spell checking
nor many other word processing support. My next choice was Notepad++. It proved
difficult to get spelling to work. No WYSIWYG either – it was, as a former
colleague of mine described, WIGIWWGY (What You Get Is What We Give You).

What I wanted was something like Microsoft Word. So I consulted [the
oracle](https://www.google.co.uk/) and found [Writage](http://www.writage.com/).

Writage
-------

“The main idea of Writage is providing opportunity to write in Markdown to those
who like Microsoft Word. There are lots of Markdown editors such as iA Writer,
Texts, WriteMonkey or Byword and online Markdown writing services, like
StackEdit, Dillinger or Markable for people who like to have minimalistic,
distraction-free interface. And there is nothing for those who prefer to use
rich interface and features of Microsoft Word.”

It is easy to install and easy to use. The only problem that I discovered,
mostly a classic *replace user and try again* problem, is creating a new
document and then pasting raw markdown into it doesn’t work. Either create a new
document and use the normal styles, or open the document from file explorer
(which automatically opens Word).
