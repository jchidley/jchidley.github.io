# Building A Raspberry Pi Home Router
**TL;DR** Replacing that crappy commerical home router with something that you can be proud of.

## Introduction

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) Problem 1: Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

F# computational expression solution:
```fsharp
let pe1 limit = eb2 { for x = 0 to limit - 1 do yield x }

let computationalSolution = pe1 1000
```
