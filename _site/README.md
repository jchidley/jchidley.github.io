# Jack Chidley's Programming Efforts
From the horse's keyboard.

## Why Github for my blog?
I use GitHub for programming source control. GitHub, magic though it is, is difficult enough to learn. I want to build on that learning.  And I want a simple life.

GitHub has excellent support for, [it's own version of](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Why Jekyll?
I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and the [Cayman](https://pages.github.com/themes/) theme, to make the blog prettier and so that it was easily read on phones, tablets.
