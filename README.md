# Jack Chidley's Programming Efforts
From the horse's keyboard.

## Why Github for my blog?
I use GitHub for programming source control. GitHub, magic though it is, is difficult enough to learn. I want to build on that learning.  And I want a simple life.

## Why Jekyll?
I chose Jekyll, and the Cayman theme, to make the blog prettier and so that it was easily read on phones, tablets.
