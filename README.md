Jack Chidley's Programming Efforts
==================================

From the horse's keyboard. Learn from my mistakes and my efforts to understand
things.

Why this Blog?
--------------

These are my main motivations:

1.  To learn about blogging by doing it.

2.  Write articles when I have learnt something that I haven’t found well
    explained elsewhere online.

3.  Provide links to other work that has helped me, thus publicising those
    people’s efforts.

I have had several aborted attempts before. Those aborted attempts made me feel
kind of useless at blogging. Then I realized that many of the web articles that
I have found useful are part of tiny blogs, blogs that are often abandoned. So I
have resolved to try again.

Why Github for my blog?
-----------------------

I use GitHub for programming source control. GitHub, magic though it is, is
difficult enough to learn. I want to build on that learning. And I want a simple
life.

GitHub has excellent support for, [it's own version
of](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/),
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Finally I trust that Github will around a while. Even if it isn’t, I’ll have a
least one clone of my efforts.

Why Jekyll?
-----------

I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and the
[Cayman](https://pages.github.com/themes/) theme, to make the blog prettier and
so that it was easily read on phones, tablets. Having things easily read on lots
of different devices is called, as I now understand, [responsive
design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design).
