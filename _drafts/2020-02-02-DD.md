## Introduction

## Zero Unused/Deleted Data

### Windows

use fsutil.exe to clear out free space.

```cmd
fsutil volume diskfree f:
fsutil file createnew F:\clear 249899469856
fsutil file setvaliddata F:\clear 249899469856
fsutil file setzerodata offset=0 length=249899469856 F:\clear
del f:\clear
```

The key is to specify a directory on the volume that you want to wipe the used data from.  Can be any directory (., .., c:\Users) as the directory is just used to identify the drive.

cipher does a secure wipe, probably not necessary and might leave random numbers behind.

```

[SDelete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sdelete) is a free download from Microsoft.  It is part of sysutils.

```cmd
sdelete -z c:\
```

### Linux

`zerofree`

## Archive and Compress Linux

`gzip` is available almost everywhere and is [fast](https://tukaani.org/lzma/benchmarks.html). `bzip2` and `xz` are also available everywhere and are [slow with high compression](https://www.rootusers.com/gzip-vs-bzip2-vs-xz-performance-comparison/). `7z` gets the [highest overall compression](https://superuser.com/a/205984).
