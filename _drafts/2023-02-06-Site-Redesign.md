# Site Redesign
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

## Introduction

I have been using Jekyll & GitHub Pages for my personal site for a number of years. When I started I picked the least-worst design and used Jekyll (with Markdown) because publishing it was easy. I liked the ease of it but I hated the website and I found myself with a small number of published blog pages and a large number of not-yet-good-enough draft pages. I never look at my published website because I hate the design. Given that my main motivation was sharing my knowledge and making it more accessible to me, clearly I have failed.

I have been researching alternatives. A better web site design, for me, would be MkDocs Material Design. It's got a good logical structure, search, contents, etc and I could, in theory, update it. But there's the rub: updating it requires knoweldge of exactly how it's built, CSS, HTML, templates, Markdown, etc. I can't get that knoweledge by using a pre-made template. The web, after all, is dominated by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, templates: it seems to me that to be really effective is to know, and use, these techologies directly.

11ty (Eleventy) is the opposite of a pre-made site. It is a static stite builder that can use any templating language (11 are baked in). There are some starter sites but, just like the web, if you want something specific, you're going to have to build it yourself.
